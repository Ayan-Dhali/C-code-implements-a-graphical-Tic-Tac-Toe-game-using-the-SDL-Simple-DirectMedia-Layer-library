# C-code-implements-a-graphical-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-the-SDL-Simple-DirectMedia-Layer-library
This C++ code creates a Tic-Tac-Toe game with SDL where the player competes against an AI using the Minimax algorithm. It features a 3x3 grid, graphical rendering of the game board, and displays the result. The AI ensures optimal moves, aiming for a win or draw. SDL_ttf is used for rendering the game result text.
